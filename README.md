# HTML5Canvas

## Overview
This project uses [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via Javascript and the HTML [<canvas>(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas)] element. The canvas is a graphics canvas.
It's a great tool to use to draw on the screen, but you can use a 3D aspect of it to create animations, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and more.
It reminds me a little of [turtle graphics with Python(https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle)].


Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs.  It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo.
- Browser support
  - Google Chrome
  - Opera 9
  - Internet Explorer version 9 and above

- Its uses and features
- Your opinions and experiences:
  - Do you think this is a good feature?
  - How do you think it will be used?
  - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
- How to run the demo
