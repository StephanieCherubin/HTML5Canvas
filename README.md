# HTML5Canvas

Overview
This project uses Canvas API. 
Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via Javascript and the HTML <canvas> element. 
It's great to use to draw on the screen, but you can use a 3D aspect of it to create animations, game graphics, data visualizatio, photo manipulation, and more.
It reminds me a little of turtle graphics with Python.
Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs. This project should be *small*. It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo. 

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows **three features** of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and **include a Readme**. The Readme should include:
    - An overview of the API and the features your project demonstrates. Include the following: 
      - Its uses and features
      - Notes on browser support
      - Your opinions and experiences:
        - Do you think this is a good feature?
        - How do you think it will be used?
        - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
    - How to run the demo
    
    - Links to: 
      - Documentation
      - Other resources
  - Medium post about my experience with your Canvas API. This article should be at least 500 words.
