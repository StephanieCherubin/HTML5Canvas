# HTML5Canvas

##Overview
This project uses [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via Javascript and the HTML [<canvas>(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas)] element. The canvas is a graphics canvas.
It's a great tool to use to draw on the screen, but you can use a 3D aspect of it to create animations, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and more.
It reminds me a little of turtle graphics with Python.
Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs.  It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo.

- Choose a web API and make a test implementation
  - Make a test app that shows **three features** of your API in use
  - Make a Github repo for your API example and **include a Readme**. The Readme should include:
    - An overview of the API and the features your project demonstrates. Include the following:
      - Its uses and features
      - Notes on browser support
      - Your opinions and experiences:
        - Do you think this is a good feature?
        - How do you think it will be used?
        - What kinds of apps do you see making use of this feature?
    - How to run the demo

    - Links to:
      - Documentation
      - Other resources
  - Medium post about my experience with your Canvas API. This article should be at least 500 words.
