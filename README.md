# HTML5Canvas

## Overview
This project uses [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via Javascript and the HTML [<canvas>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element. The canvas is a graphics canvas.
It's a great tool to use to draw on the screen, but you can use a 3D aspect of it to create animations, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and more.
It reminds me a little of [turtle graphics with Python(https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle)].


Your goal is to make a project that *tests* one of the browser APIs.  It needs to only display three features of your chosen API in action. You choose the features you want to demo.
- Browser support
  - Google Chrome
  - Opera 9
  - Internet Explorer version 9 and above

- Its uses and features
- Your opinions and experiences:
  - This is a great feature to use for artists, designers, and beginning coders. I think it will be used to create art, draw shapes, edit photos, and create animation. I also found that you can create [heat maps](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) with them and even data visualization. You can create your own graphs with this API and even animate them.
- How to run the demo
  ```
  Clone or download the project on your local machine.
  Navigate to the cloned directory on your local machine.
  Open canvas.html in the browser of your choice.
  ```

  - Make a test app that shows **three features** of your API in use


  - Medium post about my experience with your Canvas API. This article should be at least 500 words.
